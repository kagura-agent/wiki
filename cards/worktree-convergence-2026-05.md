# Worktree Isolation Convergence

**Pattern**: Multiple independent projects (5+) converged on git worktrees as the isolation primitive for parallel coding agents in April–May 2026.

## The Convergence

| Project | Stars | Language | Unique angle |
|---------|-------|----------|-------------|
| [[cadis]] | 39 | Rust | Desktop HUD, policy gates |
| [[oh-my-kimichan]] | 20 | TypeScript | Kimi Code, DAG + ensemble voting |
| [[paragents]] | 112 | Python | Permission-aware, preflight conflict checks |
| parallel-worktree-dev | 9 | Shell | Next.js + Conductor, per-worktree DB |
| amara | 4 | Zig | Terminal emulator approach |
| agentfleet | 1 | Python | Pure CLI, minimal |
| unity-claude-template | 10 | C# | Unity gamedev specific |

## Why Worktrees?

Git worktrees provide:
1. **File-level isolation** — each agent has its own working directory
2. **Branch semantics** — changes are naturally on separate branches
3. **Merge integration** — standard git merge as the coordination mechanism
4. **Zero overhead** — no VMs, containers, or copies needed
5. **Familiar mental model** — developers already understand branches

## Paragents Preflight Intent Deep Read (2026-05-07)

Grew 31→112⭐ in 5 days. The novel piece is `preflight_intent.py`:

- **PreflightIntent** dataclass: capabilities (git/shell/python/github/web/mcp), actions (git:commit, github:write), output_paths
- **Rule-based inference** from prompt text (regex for redirects, keywords for git/shell)
- **Optional LLM enrichment** — sends structured extraction prompt, merges with rule results
- **Scheduler conflict detection**: compares `output_paths` between sessions. Same path → second session gets `serialize` decision (queued behind first)
- **Capability overlap is NOT a conflict** — two sessions both using `python` is fine. Only shared output paths trigger serialization
- **Permission model**: per-capability allow/deny + per-command allowlist/blocklist + approval queue for risky ops

**Key insight**: The system distinguishes between "using the same tool" (parallel OK) vs "writing to the same place" (must serialize). This is more practical than full semantic conflict detection.

**Relation to OpenClaw**: Our subagent spawns are already workspace-isolated, but we don't detect output path conflicts between concurrent subagents. For team-lead multi-agent work, this pattern could prevent two subagents from editing the same file.

## What This Means

1. **Worktree is the consensus answer** — no one chose containers, VMs, or file-locking
2. **The real problem is coordination, not isolation** — isolation is solved; the differentiators are in scheduling (DAG vs round-robin), quality gates (ensemble voting, CI), and conflict prevention
3. **OpenClaw ACP** already supports worktrees implicitly (each spawn gets its own workspace), but lacks the preflight conflict detection that paragents adds
4. **Next frontier**: moving beyond file-level isolation to semantic-level isolation (two agents can edit the same file if they touch different functions)
