# Dream Consolidation Pattern

An automated background process that mines agent session transcripts to extract, deduplicate, and consolidate knowledge into a structured knowledge base. Named after the metaphor of sleep → memory consolidation.

## Key Design Elements

1. **Two-surface invariant**: Strict separation between **knowledge vaults** (real project knowledge) and **audit log** (meta-information about what the consolidator did). Prevents mixing meta-content with actual knowledge.

2. **Skip-already-processed**: Uses previous run's summary table as a resume marker. Only processes sessions with new content since last consolidation. Efficient for frequent runs.

3. **Four-pass procedure**: Survey → Read sessions → Consolidate → Summarize. Each pass has clear constraints and target surfaces.

4. **Targeted reconciliation**: After writing new knowledge, re-read only the pages modified in this run to check for internal contradictions. Full-vault sweep is a separate operation.

5. **Provenance tracking**: Every insight traced to source session IDs via `sources:` frontmatter. Enables auditability.

6. **Conservative deletion**: Only delete when content is strictly subsumed or explicitly contradicted. Cost of redundancy < cost of knowledge loss.

## Three Write Channels (learn-agent s20, 2026-07)

Instead of a single consolidation pass, memory can have multiple write paths all demand-driven:

1. **Inline notes** (primary): Agent writes during work. Existing in most systems.
2. **Retrieval-as-signal** (NOVEL — no other known impl): When cross-session search hits historical session data, hint: "this was re-queried, fold into permanent notes if reusable." Zero scheduler, zero extra model calls. Demand-driven promotion.
3. **Background dream** (backstop): Fire-and-forget fork, restricted tool whitelist (note CRUD only). Gated by cooldown + idle threshold.

Key principle: "没有一次专门为记忆而生的高频模型调用" — no dedicated high-frequency memory model calls.

## Idle Filter

From Codex `min_rollout_idle_hours` (adopted by learn-agent s20): Only consolidate sessions idle ≥6h. Prevents recording intermediate work states as permanent facts. Gate counting and material selection MUST use same idle cutoff (otherwise: gate opens but materials are empty → infinite empty loop).

## Pruning Exit

Memory needs an explicit delete path or it bloats over time. Consolidation agent's tool whitelist should include `delete_note`. Instruction: "superseded/contradicted notes → delete." Only system with explicit memory exit avoids accumulation of contradictory old facts.

## Implementations

- [[thclaws]] `/dream` command (v0.9.0, 2026-05-12) — first known implementation. Spawns side-channel agent with `KmsRead/Search/Write/Append/Delete` tools. Embedded AgentDef compiled into binary, overridable by user.
- [[agent-memory-hooks-neo4j]] dream.py (tomasonjo, 2026-05-05) — Neo4j graph-backed. Watermark-based incremental processing, DERIVED_FROM provenance edges, markdown-as-graph-nodes. Multi-client (Claude Code + Codex + Cursor).
- [[buddyme]] memory decay (virgo777, 2026-05-10) — Simpler variant: SequenceMatcher-based relevance scoring with 30-day linear decay, automatic archive/clean lifecycle. Not strictly "dream" but overlapping pattern (offline consolidation + dedup).
- **learn-agent s20** (7-e1even, 2026-07-17) — Three-channel write + idle filter + retrieval-as-signal + stamp-as-lock. Comparison of 9 implementations (claude-code, codex, grok, hermes, etc.). Adopted grok skeleton + codex idle filter + claude-code pruning + novel retrieval-as-signal.
- **claude-code** (Anthropic) — Most complete: per-turn extraction + 24h/5-session dream sweep + per-turn top-5 injection. Most expensive.
- **codex** (OpenAI) — Heaviest: startup dual-pipeline, SQLite task lease, git-based memory repo with diff-based forgetting.
- **grok** (xAI) — Session-end trigger, stamp-before-execute lock, simplest complete shape.

## Relevance to Our Stack

Our [[memex]] wiki maintenance is manual (doctor, lint, search). The dream pattern could automate:
- Mining daily memory logs → extracting reusable knowledge into wiki cards
- Deduplicating wiki cards that cover the same concept
- Detecting contradictions between cards written at different times
- Building audit trail of what was consolidated and when

Compare with [[auto-memory]] (automatic memory extraction) — dream goes further by also doing dedup/reconciliation, not just extraction.

## Open Questions

- How well does the model actually consolidate vs. just copying? Quality depends on the model's ability to synthesize, not just extract.
- What's the right frequency? Too often → mostly no-ops. Too rare → large batches lose context.
- How to handle the "dreams about dreams" problem — does the consolidator's own output become input for the next run? thClaws avoids this by strict surface separation.
