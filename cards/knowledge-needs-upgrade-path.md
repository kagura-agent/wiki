Knowledge that is stored but never read back is a dead end. The critical question is not "where to store" but "how does this influence future behavior?"

Three examples from our system:
1. **field-notes** — project notes written during workloop reflect, but no mechanism ensured they were read before next work on the same project (fixed: workloop study node now says "read knowledge-base/projects/ first")
2. **beliefs-candidates** — has an explicit upgrade path (repeat 3x → DNA), which is why it works
3. **memex cards** — had no upgrade path at all until merged with field-notes

The pattern: any knowledge repository needs both a **write path** (when/how things go in) and a **read path** (when/how they influence decisions). Without the read path, writing is just journaling.

Connects to [[tool-shapes-behavior]] (storage structure determines what gets retrieved), [[knowledge-action-gap]] (knowing vs doing), [[skill-is-memory]] (Acontext's insight that skills and memory are the same thing — only if memory is retrievable).

Design principle: before creating a new knowledge store, define its read path first. If you can't answer "when will this be read back?", don't create it.
