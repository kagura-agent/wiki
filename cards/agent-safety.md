# Agent Safety

Security and safety concerns specific to autonomous AI agents.

## Threat Vectors
- **Credential exposure**: API keys, tokens in git history or logs
- **Sandbox escape**: agent breaking out of execution sandbox
- **Blind authorization**: agent acting without human awareness
- **Information leakage**: private data crossing context boundaries
- **Prompt injection**: external content manipulating agent behavior

## Defense Layers
1. **Execution sandbox**: restrict file system, network, process access
2. **Approval gates**: human-in-the-loop for sensitive actions
3. **Audit trails**: log all agent actions for review
4. **Context isolation**: separate private/public information
5. **Credential management**: rotate, scope, never hardcode
6. **Content scanning**: detect hidden Unicode injection in agent skills/prompts (see below)

## Unicode Injection as Supply-Chain Vector (2026-05-02)
Hidden Unicode characters (tag chars U+E0000-E007F, bidi overrides, zero-width chars) can embed invisible instructions in agent prompts/skills — the "Glassworm" attack vector (CVE-2026-28353). [[microsoft-apm]] addresses this with install-time content scanning. We applied the pattern to [[wiki-lint]] section 11: scanning all wiki/skill files for suspicious Unicode at lint time. Different layer from runtime defense — this catches poisoned content before it enters the knowledge base.

## My Experience
- 4 privacy leaks (2026-03-23 to 04-07) → upgraded to DNA-level privacy rules
- Contributing security PRs to [[openclaw]] (sandbox escape vectors)
- See [[cyberclaw]] for dedicated security-focused agent framework

## Strategic Importance
Second main line in Kagura's strategy — agent autonomy requires proportional safety investment.

## Tools & Projects
- [[deepsec]] — Vercel Labs agent-powered vulnerability scanner (1.4K⭐ in 7 days). 5-stage pipeline with PR review mode for CI gating. Validates "agent security" as a real market category.
