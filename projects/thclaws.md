# thClaws — Rust-Native Agent Harness Platform

"Sovereign by design" — native Rust AI agent workspace with desktop GUI (Tauri), CLI REPL, and non-interactive mode in one binary. By ThaiGPT Co., Ltd. (Thailand). 612⭐ in 9 days (created 2026-04-20).

## Architecture

**Single crate** (`crates/core`) — monolithic but well-organized:
- `agent.rs` — event-streaming agent loop (provider → tool → recurse)
- `repl.rs` (231KB!) — massive REPL with all commands; this is the heart
- `team.rs` (83KB) — filesystem-based multi-agent coordination
- `gui.rs` (118KB) — Tauri frontend bindings
- `shared_session.rs` (71KB) — session state management
- `shell_dispatch.rs` (85KB) — bash tool dispatch

**Provider system**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, DashScope, OpenRouter, Ollama (native + cloud), plus generic `oai/*` slot. Provider switching mid-session via `/provider`.

**Tools**: bash, read, write, edit, grep, glob, ls, search, tasks, todo, kms, web, plan, ask. Standard coding agent toolkit.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Claude Code Compatibility Layer
thClaws reads `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.mcp.json` — it's explicitly designed as a Claude Code alternative that runs against any provider. This is the "sovereign" pitch: same project config, your choice of model.

### 2. KMS (Knowledge Management System)
Karpathy-style wiki: `index.md` TOC injected into system prompt, `KmsRead`/`KmsSearch` tools for on-demand retrieval. No embeddings, no vector store — grep + read. Two scopes: user-level (`~/.config/thclaws/kms/`) and project-level (`.thclaws/kms/`).

Compare with [[memex]]: memex uses wikilinks + backlinks + search index; thClaws KMS is simpler (flat pages + TOC), but the "inject index into system prompt" approach is identical to how OpenClaw loads wiki/L1.md.

### 3. Agent Teams (Filesystem Coordination)
Multiple thClaws processes coordinate via shared filesystem:
- Per-agent inbox (JSON array with file locking)
- Task queue with claim/complete/dependency tracking
- Heartbeat status files
- Each agent in its own tmux pane + optional git worktree

This is remarkably similar to [[cadis]]'s worktree-isolated coding agents but with JSON-over-filesystem instead of IPC.

### 4. Skills = SKILL.md + scripts/
Same format as OpenClaw skills (YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions + optional scripts). `whenToUse` triggers, model picks automatically or user invokes as `/<skill-name>`. Install from git URL.

## Comparison with OpenClaw

| Aspect | thClaws | OpenClaw |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Language | Rust (single binary) | Node.js (npm install) |
| UI | Desktop GUI (Tauri) + CLI | CLI + channel integrations (Discord, Feishu, Telegram) |
| Multi-provider | Built-in (8+ providers) | Built-in (provider configs) |
| Skills | SKILL.md (compatible format) | SKILL.md (same format, plus ClawHub registry) |
| MCP | stdio + HTTP Streamable + OAuth | MCP support |
| Memory | KMS (grep-based wiki) | memex (wikilink graph + search) |
| Multi-agent | Filesystem mailbox + tmux panes | ACP harness (persistent sessions) |
| Channel integration | None (local-only) | Discord, Feishu, Telegram, WhatsApp |
| Deployment model | Desktop app | Server daemon (24/7) |

## Insights

1. **SKILL.md is becoming a standard.** thClaws, OpenClaw, and Claude Code all use the same format. This validates the approach — skill portability across harnesses is real.

2. **"Sovereign" = provider-agnostic + local-first.** The pitch is explicitly "don't depend on one vendor." This resonates post-Claude-Code-malware-regression (HN 190pts today). Market signal: users want provider optionality.

3. **Filesystem coordination for multi-agent is pragmatic.** No gRPC, no message bus — just JSON files with flock(). Works because agents are on the same machine. Contrast with OpenClaw's ACP which works across machines/processes.

4. **GUI matters for non-engineers.** "Any knowledge worker, not just engineers" — Chat tab for researchers/PMs, Terminal for devs. OpenClaw addresses this via channel integrations (Discord/Feishu), but a native GUI is a different UX category.

5. **Mono-binary in Rust is a deployment advantage.** No npm, no Python venv, no dependency hell. `cargo build` → one binary. But 231KB repl.rs suggests maintainability challenges.

6. **repl.rs at 231KB is a code smell.** Single file handling all REPL logic. This will bottleneck contributions. Compare with OpenClaw's modular command system.

## Relevance to Our Direction

- **Low direct threat**: thClaws targets desktop users; OpenClaw targets server-side 24/7 agents with multi-channel integration. Different niches.
- **Skill format convergence**: Validates our SKILL.md approach. Cross-harness skills are becoming real.
- **KMS pattern**: Their KMS is our wiki/memex with a different name. "Inject TOC into system prompt" = exactly our L1.md approach.
- **Team coordination**: Their filesystem-based approach could inspire simpler multi-agent coordination when agents are co-located.

## Growth Signal

76 commits from lead (mozeal), 4 other contributors. Created 2026-04-20, 612⭐ in 9 days. Growth rate: ~68⭐/day. Healthy for a new project but early. Watch for: community contributions, plugin ecosystem growth, whether the mono-crate architecture scales.

## v0.8.0 Update (2026-05-05): `/goal` Persistent Objective System

805⭐ (+193 since last check). New `/goal` feature is the headline of v0.8.0.

### Architecture: `goal_state.rs` (451 lines)

**State machine**: Active → Complete | Abandoned | Blocked (terminal states auto-stop loops)

**Three authority-separated tools** (Phase C1):
- `RecordGoalProgress` — mid-loop checkpoint, status stays Active
- `MarkGoalComplete` — terminal, requires audit evidence
- `MarkGoalBlocked` — terminal, requires blocker reason

This separation prevents the model from casually marking goals complete without evidence.

**Budget system**: optional token budget + time budget. When exhausted, switches to a soft-stop prompt that says "wrap up, don't start new work" but doesn't force completion.

**Auto-continuation** (Phase D1): `--auto` flag on `/goal start` makes the worker auto-queue `/goal continue` after each turn (if tool calls were made and status is still Active). Without `--auto`, it's manual or wrapped in `/loop`.

**Persistence**: JSONL events (`goal_snapshot`), survives `/load` session reload.

### Anti-Sycophancy Discipline (goal_continue.md prompt)

The audit prompt is remarkably rigorous:
- "Restate the objective as concrete deliverables"
- "Build a prompt-to-artifact checklist"
- "Do not accept proxy signals as completion" (passing tests, effort, memory of work)
- "Treat uncertainty as not achieved"
- "Only mark complete when the audit shows objective actually achieved"
- Budget exhaustion explicitly stated as NOT completion

This is the same anti-"讨好模式" principle from our AGENTS.md, but formalized into a prompt template. The `<untrusted_objective>` wrapper also shows prompt injection awareness.

### Relevance to OpenClaw

| Aspect | thClaws /goal | OpenClaw equivalent |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| Persistent objectives | JSONL state + session-scoped | FlowForge workflows (but not per-session) |
| Budget tracking | Built-in token/time limits | No equivalent (manual session awareness) |
| Audit before completion | Prompt-enforced checklist | AGENTS.md 验证纪律 (cultural, not enforced) |
| Auto-continuation | Opt-in per-goal | Heartbeat + cron (different mechanism) |
| Authority separation | 3 tools (progress/complete/blocked) | No equivalent |

**Key insight**: thClaws formalizes what we do culturally (verification discipline) into a mechanical enforcement layer. The model literally cannot mark a goal complete without going through the audit prompt. This is more reliable than relying on the model's compliance with AGENTS.md guidelines.

**Potential application**: Could we add a similar goal-state system to FlowForge or OpenClaw sessions? A "goal" that persists across heartbeats, tracks token budget, and mechanically enforces completion audits? See [[flowforge]] for workflow comparison.

### Other v0.8.0 Changes
- NVIDIA direct model support
- Gemini `thoughtSignature` preservation in function calling
- Thinking deltas surfaced in `-p` print mode
- Sidebar goal indicator (desktop GUI)

## Applied: Mechanical Enforcement in FlowForge (2026-05-06)

The `/goal` system's key insight — verification discipline should be enforced by topology, not by instruction — was applied to our [[flowforge]] `workloop.yaml`:

- Added `pre_push_audit` node between `implement` and `submit`
- Requires pasting actual test output, diff-stat, interface check results, and plan-item checklist
- Agent cannot reach `submit` without providing evidence (not just claiming "verified")

See [[mechanical-enforcement-via-topology]] for the generalized pattern.

*Deep read: 2026-04-29 (initial), 2026-05-06 (v0.8.0 /goal deep read). Source: GitHub API (goal_state.rs, default_prompts/goal_continue.md, goal_budget_limit.md, commits, release notes)*

## v0.9.0 Update (2026-05-12): /dream KMS Consolidation + Stream Hardening

> See below for v0.9.2-v0.9.4 update (2026-05-13)

871⭐ (+259 since last check, +3% since 848). v0.8.4 → v0.9.0 in 4 days (5 releases: v0.8.8, v0.8.9, v0.9.0 on 05-11/12).

### /dream — Built-in KMS Consolidation Agent

A first-class slash command that spawns a side-channel agent to consolidate/deduplicate KMS pages by mining recent sessions. Key details:

- **Four-pass operating procedure**: insight surfacing, deduplication, audit-trail authoring
- **New `KmsDelete` tool** (`requires_approval = true`): allows dream agent to remove redundant pages
- **Embedded AgentDef**: compiled into binary via `include_str!`, overridable by user's `.thclaws/agents/dream.md`
- **Override priority**: builtins → legacy JSON → user/project .md dirs → plugins (no-clobber)
- **Flags**: `--all` (consolidate everything), `--skip-dreamed` (skip already-processed), auto-rename

**Relevance to us**: This is automated wiki maintenance — exactly what we do manually with memex doctor/lint. The "dream" metaphor (sleep → consolidate memories) is compelling. Could inspire a similar automated consolidation workflow for our wiki/memex.

### Stream Timeout Hardening
- Configurable stream chunk timeout (default 120s, was 30s)
- Per-feature timeout override (e.g., /dream can have longer timeout than normal chat)
- Applied to all providers, not just Anthropic
- Addresses the same idle-timeout problem we hit with subagents on Copilot API (~60s)

### Other v0.8.8-v0.9.0 Changes
- Anthropic agent resume support
- `/research` verify pass
- Sidebar polish
- Session snapshot wiring for serve mode
- `AskUserQuestion` bridge for serve mode

### Velocity Signal
5 releases in 2 days is extreme velocity. 871⭐ in 22 days (created 04-20) = ~40⭐/day sustained. Still primarily mozeal (lead) but external PRs appearing (#80-84). Community growing.

## v0.9.2-v0.9.4 Update (2026-05-13): LINE Bridge + ChatGPT Codex + SSO

879⭐ (+8 since yesterday). **Three releases in 24 hours** — extreme velocity continues.

### LINE Bridge (v0.9.2-v0.9.4) — Messaging Platform as Remote Control

The most architecturally interesting development. thClaws implements messaging platform integration with **inverted topology** compared to [[openclaw]]:

| Aspect | OpenClaw | thClaws LINE Bridge |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| Agent location | Server (24/7 daemon) | Local machine (user's laptop) |
| Messaging role | Primary interface | Remote control surface |
| Direction | Messages → agent | Agent ← relay ← LINE |
| Always-on | Yes | Only when desktop app is running |

**Architecture** (5 layers):
1. **LINE webhook → Relay server** (`line.thclaws.ai`, Axum + Redis + Postgres on k3s) — receives LINE messages
2. **Relay → WebSocket → Client** — per-install WS connection, JWT auth, pairing-code flow
3. **Client bridge** (`crates/core/src/line/`) — WS client + `LineApprover` for tool approvals
4. **Frontend modal** — paste pairing code → POST `/pair` → start WS
5. **Worker integration** — `ShellInput::LineMessage` arm in `shared_session.rs` drives `Agent::run_turn`

**Key design decisions**:
- **Wire protocol is intentionally documented** for third-party relay implementers — `thclaws-technical-manual/line-bridge.md` is the contract. The official relay is workspace-only (not in public mirror), but the protocol is open.
- **Reply-first / push-fallback** for LINE API quota management: reply tokens are free but expire in 60s and are single-use. Push messages count against monthly quota (200/month on free tier). Relay tries reply first, falls back to push on error.
- **Quick Reply chips** for tool approval: mutating-tool approval prompts route to LINE as tappable `postback` buttons (Approve/Deny). Same concept as OpenClaw's native approvals but mapped to LINE's Quick Reply API.
- **LineApprover routing** (v0.9.4): when the browser GUI is open, approvals route there instead of LINE — the relay exposes `/chat-bridge/has-browser` check. Smart multi-surface routing.
- **Reconnect with exponential backoff** — k8s rolling updates drop WS connections, presence TTL (60s) absorbs the gap.

**Relevance to us**: This is the first competitor implementing the "messaging platform as agent interface" pattern that OpenClaw pioneered with Discord/Feishu/Telegram. The topology is different (local agent + remote relay vs server-side agent), but the core UX — chat with your agent from your phone, approve tool calls via tappable buttons — is identical. The relay-as-a-service model (documented wire protocol, anyone can implement their own relay) is worth noting as an alternative to OpenClaw's built-in channel plugin approach.

### ChatGPT Codex Provider (PR #88)

652 additions, 11 files. Ported from "themion" — uses ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team subscription OAuth to access Codex. No separate API key needed. This brings the provider count to **17 supported backends** with the 7-variant `ProviderEvent` normalization layer.

### SSO/OIDC (v0.9.5-era)

- Standard mode: Google (+ Azure stubbed), env-supplied `CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET`
- Enterprise mode: signed policy file pins to org-managed IdP
- PKCE flow, keychain-backed session storage (`thclaws-sso-<sha256-of-issuer>`)
- This is **enterprise readiness** — OpenClaw doesn't have SSO yet

### Post-v0.9.4 Sync (7.3K additions)

- OpenRouter "free only" toggle (Settings + in-picker)
- Model catalogue UX improvements
- `secrets.rs` refactoring
- User manual ch21 (LINE and browser chat)

### Issue Analysis — Architecture Insights

- **#82 (AskUser IPC gap)**: `AskUserQuestion` doesn't work through AgentSdk provider (Claude Code subprocess) — the SDK runs tools opaquely, thClaws's tool registry never sees them. This is a fundamental IPC boundary problem that any harness wrapping Claude Code's SDK will face.
- **#58 (GUI deps in CLI binary)**: Even `--cli` mode links against Wayland/WebKit at runtime. The single-binary advantage breaks on headless servers. Feature-flag compilation (`--no-default-features`) would fix this but isn't shipped yet.
- **#72 (Config plumbing gap)**: `maxTokens` parsed from settings but hardcoded to 8192 in `Agent::new()`. Classic mono-crate coupling — config values need manual threading through all call sites. 8 call sites + `ProductionAgentFactory` needed patching.

### Velocity & Community

9 releases in 2 days (v0.9.0-v0.9.4 + post-sync). 879⭐ in 23 days = ~38⭐/day sustained. Thai user base is engaged (issues in Thai, mozeal responds bilingually). mozeal's issue response quality is exceptional — detailed, commit-referenced, bilingual. External contributors appearing (#85 perf fix, #88 Codex port). Still predominantly a one-person project (mozeal) but community is growing.

### 05-14 Followup — Sustained Extreme Velocity

905⭐ (+26⭐/day this week). 3 more releases (v0.9.5→v0.9.7) in 24 hours:
- **v0.9.6**: Gateway crate removed from public repo (internal infrastructure separation)
- **v0.9.7**: Streaming correctness fixes, opt-in browser Gemma, docs

**Community growth confirmed**: 42 unique issue authors + 42 external PRs in 30 days. 127 forks. New contributor @nazt (ChatGPT Codex provider, PR#88 merged). PR#89 (OpenCodeGo multi-wire-format) from @baslenvm was closed (not merged) — interesting that they're being selective despite rapid velocity.

**Pattern**: thClaws's velocity model is "accept external provider PRs fast but maintain code quality bar" — PR#89 rejected despite adding a valid provider. This is healthy for a 900⭐ project with 8 external contributors.

**OpenCodeGo PR#89 insight**: Proposed multi-wire-format provider (OpenAI + Anthropic + Alibaba wire formats in one module). Rejected — probably too complex for a single provider module. The multi-wire-format idea itself is interesting for [[openclaw-architecture]].

## v0.20.0 Update (2026-05-26): Telegram Full Stack + 1K⭐ Milestone

1,043⭐ (+138 since last check, +15.3%). **Crossed 1,000⭐** — first major milestone for a 36-day-old project.

### Release Velocity (05-20 → 05-26)

- **v0.19.0** (05-25): Telegram bot adapter Tier 1
- **v0.20.0** (05-26): Telegram channels + forum topics + streaming preview
- Shell-aware bash seatbelts vs shell-quoting bypasses (#125)
- Grapheme-aware Backspace for Thai/combining-mark input (#126)

**Telegram integration** follows the same relay pattern as LINE bridge — messaging platform as remote control surface. Now supports channels, forum topics, and streaming preview. This brings thClaws to 3 messaging surfaces (GUI, LINE, Telegram) — converging with [[openclaw]]'s multi-channel approach.

### Community Health: 🟢 THRIVING (6/6)

4+ unique external contributors in last 3 days (modtanoii, gobikom, ultramcu, mozeal). PRs merged quickly. 143 forks. Community is no longer single-person — genuine multi-contributor project.

### Growth Trajectory

| Date | Stars | Δ% | Key Event |
|------|-------|-----|----------|
| 04-29 | 612 | — | Initial deep read |
| 05-05 | 805 | +31.5% | v0.8.0 /goal system |
| 05-13 | 879 | +9.2% | LINE bridge + SSO |
| 05-20 | 949 | +8.0% | Approaching 1K |
| 05-26 | 1,043 | +9.9% | 1K⭐, Telegram, v0.20.0 |

Sustained ~30⭐/day growth over 5+ weeks. Rare for a non-VC-backed project. ThaiGPT's community + multi-provider pitch continues to resonate.
