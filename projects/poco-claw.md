# Poco-Claw — OpenClaw's Direct Competitor

MIT, 1,328⭐, 121 forks. 3-core-dev team (qychen2001: 502, ffy6511: 344, Phil-Fan: 190 commits). Very active, pushing daily. Self-describes as "a more beautiful and easier-to-use alternative to OpenClaw."

## Architecture

4-service monorepo:
- **Frontend** — Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui
- **Backend** — FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.0, PostgreSQL, Alembic migrations
- **Executor** — FastAPI + **Claude Agent SDK** (official), hook-based extensibility
- **Executor Manager** — FastAPI + APScheduler, task scheduling & dispatch

Flow: User → Frontend → Backend → Executor Manager → Executor → Claude Agent SDK → Callbacks → Backend → Frontend polling

## Key Design Decisions (from specs/constitution/)

### Chat-First, Task-Derived
The core pivot: conversations precede tasks. Users enter channels, chat, and **explicitly derive tasks from messages**. Tasks are not the entry point — they're spawned artifacts. This is the opposite of issue-centered execution.

Model: `Server → Conversation (Channel|DM) → Task → Agent`

### Agent Identity: 4-Layer Split
1. **Identity** — who the agent is (name, avatar, profile)
2. **Preset** — runtime config (model, capabilities, tools, sub-agents)
3. **Persistent State** — long-term state directory (MEMORY.md, knowledge, context)
4. **Runtime** — execution container instance

This is more explicit than our approach where SOUL.md conflates identity with some runtime concerns.

### Single-Writer Rule
Each agent gets **at most one writable persistent runtime**. Other tasks queue or get cloned read-only snapshots. This prevents concurrent state pollution — a problem we haven't formally addressed (our subagents can write to the same workspace concurrently).

### Temporary Runtimes
Read-only snapshot of persistent state + explicit merge back. Clean separation of exploratory work from committed state.

## Features
- **Sandbox**: Docker-based isolated containers, local directory mounting for self-hosted
- **IM**: DingTalk, Feishu, Telegram (embedded backend messaging)
- **Memory**: mem0-powered (preferences, project context, past interactions)
- **Channels**: Server/Channel/DM model (Discord-like)
- **Artifacts**: Render HTML, PDF, Markdown, images, videos, Xmind, Excalidraw, Drawio
- **Playback**: Replay command I/O, browser sessions, tool calls
- **Background execution**: Agent keeps running after browser closes
- **Mobile**: Control agent from phone
- **MCP & Skills**: Extensible tool ecosystem
- **Browser**: Built-in autonomous web research
- **Plan Mode**: Claude Code-style planning

## Spec-Driven Development

Notable: `specs/constitution/` directory with dated design specs written before implementation:
- 2026-05-04: Server/Channel/Agent persistence
- 2026-05-05: Channel shared context and artifacts
- 2026-05-06: Agent observability, tasks, and persistence
- 2026-05-07: Agent dispatch latency optimization
- 2026-05-08: Persistent agent message passing & tool injection

Plus `specs/research/` for exploratory investigations. This is a mature engineering process.

## Issues / Real Usage Signals

- Executor container won't exit (resource leak) — real production bug
- IM (Feishu) messages don't auto-refresh in web — integration gap
- Multi-tenant question (8 comments) — users want per-user sandboxes
- MCP tool errors — real usage, not README-ware

## Comparison with OpenClaw

| Dimension | OpenClaw | Poco-Claw |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Interface | CLI-first + channel adapters | Web UI-first + IM integration |
| Agent loop | Custom agent loop | Claude Agent SDK (official) |
| Identity | SOUL.md/AGENTS.md flat files | 4-layer DB-backed split |
| Sandbox | Direct host execution | Docker containers |
| Memory | Markdown files (MEMORY.md, wiki/) | mem0 (vector-based) |
| Collaboration | Single human + agent | Multi-user, multi-agent team |
| State protection | None (subagents share workspace) | Single-writer rule |
| IM | Discord, Feishu, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc. | DingTalk, Feishu, Telegram |
| Deployment | Node.js single process | Docker Compose (4 services + PG) |

## Strategic Insights

1. **Validates our channel model** — They independently arrived at conversation-as-primary-unit, confirming our intuition
2. **4-layer identity split is worth studying** — We conflate identity/preset/state; their explicit separation is cleaner for multi-agent scenarios
3. **Single-writer rule is a real gap for us** — Our subagents can concurrently write to `~/.openclaw/workspace/` without coordination. As we scale subagent usage, this will bite us
4. **Web UI vs CLI is a positioning choice, not a technical one** — They went polished UI; we went system-level access. Different markets
5. **Claude Agent SDK adoption** — They use the official SDK rather than rolling their own agent loop. Tradeoff: less control, faster integration with Anthropic updates
6. **Spec-driven development** — Their `specs/constitution/` approach is disciplined and worth emulating for our own major decisions

## Relevance to Our Direction

- **Not a threat**: Different market segments (team collaboration platform vs personal AI companion)
- **Design validation**: Chat-first, agent-as-teammate model confirms our direction
- **Architectural learning**: 4-layer identity split and single-writer rule are concrete improvements we could adopt
- **Competitive intelligence**: Shows where the "OpenClaw alternative" market is heading — Web UI, sandboxing, team features

### Applied: Single-Writer Rule → team-lead (2026-05-13)

Codified the single-writer rule as a **Concurrent Work Guard** in `skills/team-lead/SKILL.md`:
- Mandatory preflight path-overlap check before parallel assignment
- Worktree isolation upgraded from suggestion to requirement
- Re-read gate after subagent returns (adapted from [[concurrent-agent-file-coordination]] Hermes 3-layer defense)
- Serialization rule: shared output paths → sequential assignment

Merged insights from three sources: Poco-claw single-writer, [[concurrent-agent-file-coordination]] (Hermes), and [[worktree-convergence-2026-05]] (paragents preflight intent).

## Update 2026-05-29: Entity-First Structured Channel Mentions

PR #119-120 (merged 05-25): Major architectural shift from text-based `@mention` scanning to **structured entity protocol**.

### The Problem
Text-based mention detection is fragile:
- Display name collisions (test explicitly verifies: `@Reviewer` ≠ handle `api-specialist` even when display_name is "Reviewer")
- Regex-scan false positives when message text happens to contain `@token` patterns
- No typed context — agent gets a string, has to parse it to find referenced artifacts/tasks

### The Solution: `content.entities` Protocol

Messages now carry structured entity lists:
```python
content = {
    "text": "Review this @api-specialist #artifact-42",
    "entities": [
        {"kind": "agent", "action": "mention", "target_id": "<uuid>"},
        {"kind": "artifact", "action": "reference", "target_id": "<uuid>"},
        {"kind": "task", "action": "reference", "target_id": "<uuid>"},
        {"kind": "message", "action": "reference", "target_id": "<uuid>"},
    ]
}
```

Key design:
- **`@` = mention** (user/agent) — triggers agent execution
- **`#` = reference** (artifact/task/thread) — injected as `TriggerReferences` in the trigger envelope
- **`TriggerReferences`**: typed UUID lists (`message_ids`, `artifact_ids`, `task_ids`) passed to agent, not text
- **Dedupe**: `channel-trigger:{message_id}:{agent_id}` prevents double-triggering
- **Versioned envelope**: `version: 1` field for protocol evolution
- **Fallback**: Old messages still regex-scanned; new messages use entities

### Architectural Insight

This is the same evolution pattern as major chat platforms:
- Telegram: `message.entities[]` with typed offsets
- Discord: interactions + resolved mentions
- Slack: blocks + parsed mentions

Moving from "text is the message" to "text is one layer of a structured document" — necessary when messages trigger programmatic actions (agent dispatch), not just human reading.

### Relevance to OpenClaw

OpenClaw uses gateway-level text mention detection for channel dispatch. The structured entity approach would:
1. Eliminate false trigger from display name collisions
2. Enable typed context injection (agent receives artifact IDs, not text references)
3. Support multi-agent coordination with precise handoff metadata

Not immediately actionable (different architecture — OpenClaw is gateway-based, Poco-claw is server-based), but the principle of **entity-first dispatch** vs **text-scan dispatch** is worth internalizing. See [[entity-first-dispatch]] as a potential concept card.
