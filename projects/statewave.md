# Statewave

Open-source **memory runtime** for AI agents. Python + Postgres (pgvector). AGPL-3.0 + commercial dual license. v0.7.2 (May 2026), daily commits.

## What It Does

Three-stage memory pipeline: **Ingest → Compile → Retrieve**.

1. **Episodes** (raw events) — append-only, immutable. Chat messages, webhook events, connector imports.
2. **Memories** (compiled) — typed, scored, with provenance back to source episodes. Three kinds: `profile_fact`, `procedure`, `episode_summary`.
3. **Context bundles** (retrieval) — ranked, token-bounded assemblies ready for prompts. Deterministic scoring: kind priority + recency + semantic similarity + temporal validity + session awareness.

## Architecture Insights

### Compiler Duality
Two compiler modes: **heuristic** (regex patterns, zero deps, local-only) and **LLM** (LiteLLM, any provider). Heuristic is default — good enough for demos and testing, but the LLM path extracts richer memories. Smart design: same interface, swap at deploy time.

**Comparison to our system**: We do "compilation" manually — raw daily logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) → curated `MEMORY.md`. Statewave automates this with structured types and confidence scores.

### Ranked Retrieval with Multi-Signal Scoring
Context assembly uses ~15 scoring signals combined additively:
- Kind priority (profile_fact: 10, procedure: 8, episode_summary: 5)
- Recency (0-5 linear)
- Semantic similarity via pgvector (0-8, highest weight)
- Temporal validity bonus/penalty (+3/-4)
- Session boost (+6 for active session)
- Lexical overlap bonus (0-4, tiebreaker for narrow queries)
- Support-specific: urgency keywords, open issues, repeat-issue detection

**Key insight**: They hit a real bug where semantic scores were too close together and kind priority dominated, producing wrong results. Fixed by adding lexical overlap as tiebreaker. This is the kind of production learning that README architectures never surface.

### Conflict Resolution
Word-overlap similarity (threshold 0.6) within same (subject, kind) group. Newer supersedes older. Simple but effective — no fancy dedup, just pairwise comparison within groups. Superseded memories keep `valid_to` timestamp for audit trail.

### Per-Kind Memory TTL (v0.7)
Different memory types decay at different rates. Episode summaries expire faster than profile facts. Configurable per deployment.

**Connection to [[beliefs-upgrade-quality-gate]]**: Our "Durability" dimension in beliefs evaluation is the manual version of this — we ask "will this still be true in 30 days?" while Statewave encodes it as a TTL value per kind.

### Bi-Temporal Anchoring (v0.7.2, PR #71)
Four-commit fix that lifted benchmark scores from 0.388 → 0.535 (beating Mem0 0.382, Zep 0.244). Key lessons:

1. **valid_from from payload event time** — `episode_valid_from(ep)` helper prefers `payload.event_time` → `payload.messages[0].timestamp` → `ep.created_at` → `now()`. Previously every memory carried `valid_from = POST time`, making temporal queries useless. Parses ISO 8601 + natural language ("1:56 pm on 8 May").

2. **Date grounding in compiled content** — LLM compiler prompt gained "Temporal grounding" section: resolve relative phrases ("yesterday", "last Saturday") against message timestamp. `_render_memory_line` prefixes `[YYYY-MM-DD]` as safety net.

3. **Granular detail extraction** — Previous "concrete, generalizable facts" wording caused LLM to emit summaries and skip specifics. New rules: specific attributes ARE generalizable facts. Preserve colors, brands, quantities, names, places, preferences. "Better to emit 30 concrete granular memories than 5 vague ones — the retrieval layer ranks them; the compiler's job is recall." Compiled count: 111 → 154 (+39%).

4. **Embedding backfill on async path** — **The headline bug**: async compile route (default SDK mode) was missing one-line `schedule_embedding_backfill` call. Every async-compiled memory had `embedding=NULL`. Semantic search returned empty, silently falling back to lexical+temporal only. **Statewave's signature feature was effectively disabled.**

**Lesson for us**: The granularity insight is directly applicable. Our MEMORY.md curation tends toward summaries ("worked on X") instead of specifics ("discovered that Y uses Z pattern for W reason"). The embedding bug pattern is also cautionary — a missing one-liner silently degraded the most important feature.

### Sensitivity Labels & Policy Engine (v0.8.0, PRs #49 + #76)
Shipped 2026-05-14. Previously design-stage (#50), now fully implemented. The governance pivot: receipts (#49) + policy layer (#76) = auditable memory access control.

**Policy engine architecture** (`server/services/policy.py`, 561 lines):
- YAML/JSON policy bundles with strict schema validation — unknown predicates fail at load time, not silently pass through
- 6 predicates: `memory_has_any_label`, `memory_has_all_labels`, `caller_type`, `caller_type_in`, `caller_type_not_in`, `caller_id`. AND within `when:`, first-match-wins across rules, default-allow
- 2 actions: `deny` (exclude) and `redact` (replace content with `[REDACTED by policy]`, memory still visible in receipt)
- Content-hashed bundles stored immutably — "what did policy abc123 say on date Y?" is answerable forever
- **Fail-open design**: DB errors → no filtering, same as pre-policy. Safe for incremental rollout
- **log_only vs enforce modes**: tenant can observe policy decisions for weeks before enabling enforcement. Receipts record decisions in both modes. This is the killer feature for adoption — zero-risk trial

**Per-memory labels** (migration 0018):
- `memories.sensitivity_labels TEXT[]` + GIN index
- Operator-supplied via `PATCH /v1/memories/{id}/labels`
- Normalized: dedup + lowercase + trim. Cap 32 per memory

**Multi-tenant bundle resolution**:
1. Tenant-specific active bundle → 2. Global active bundle → 3. No bundle (default-allow)
- 60s in-process cache, bustable via `/admin/policy/reload`
- Composite `(tenant_id, bundle_hash)` uniqueness — same YAML can be installed independently by different tenants (#79)

**Test quality**: 26 unit tests + integration tests. Tests cover schema validation errors, predicate semantics, AND/OR logic, first-match-wins, mode enforcement, receipt projection. Each documented error has a corresponding test — the kind of coverage that catches regressions.

**Architecture insight — "make the safe thing easy"**: The `log_only` default + first-match-wins + fail-open is a textbook enterprise adoption pattern. Most projects default to `enforce` and wonder why nobody enables their security feature. Statewave defaults to observability and lets compliance teams build confidence before enforcement. Connection to [[mechanism-vs-evolution]]: governance mechanisms only work if they can be adopted incrementally.

**Relevance to us**: Our MEMORY.md has a manual access control (load only in DM, not in groups). Statewave's policy layer shows what the programmatic version looks like. The `log_only → enforce` pattern is worth noting for any future access control we build — always start with observability.

## What's Interesting for Us

1. **Episode → Compile → Retrieve pipeline** — structured version of our raw logs → MEMORY.md → session startup. Could we add confidence scores to our memory entries?
2. **Provenance chain** — every memory traces to source episodes. We don't have this. When something in MEMORY.md is wrong, we can't trace where it came from.
3. **Token budgets on context** — they enforce a hard token limit on context bundles. We just load everything and hope it fits.
4. **Conflict resolution** — automatic superseding of outdated facts. We do this manually during MEMORY.md curation.

## Limitations

- **Support-agent focused** — the scoring signals (SLA, handoff packs, health scores) are tuned for customer support. General-purpose agent memory would need different signals.
- **Postgres dependency** — can't work without pgvector. Not embeddable.
- **AGPL license** — commercial use requires paid license. Can't integrate directly.
- **Single-subject retrieval** — context assembly is per-subject. Cross-subject reasoning (connecting patterns across different users/entities) isn't supported.

## Ecosystem Position

Sits in the **memory infrastructure** layer of [[self-evolving-agent-landscape]]. Complements agent frameworks (doesn't replace them). Closest comparison: [[hermes-memory-skills]] (4-dimension scoring) but Statewave is a standalone service, not a library.

## Followup 2026-06-01: 214⭐, 🟠→🟢 THRIVING, Multi-Tenancy Hardening

**Stars**: 214 (was 212, slight recovery from 220 dip. Star instability was noise, not decline).

### Community Health Upgrade: 🟢 THRIVING (5/6)

Previous assessment (05-23): "Solo maintainer, community signal weakening." Now: **48 external PRs in 30 days, 10 unique issue authors, 3 unique merged PR authors.** skarL007 emerged as a significant second contributor.

### skarL007's Multi-Tenancy Sprint (05-29—05-31)

6 PRs merged in 48 hours, all scoping existing features by tenant:
1. `fix(handoff): scope active session + order recent context newest-first`
2. `fix(compile-jobs): scope status polling by tenant`
3. `fix(conflicts): scope resolution by tenant`
4. `fix(memories): reject non-positive search limit`
5. `fix(config): validate enum-like settings fields at startup`
6. `fix(conflicts): strip punctuation when tokenizing overlap`

**Pattern**: These are isolation bugs — features that worked for single-tenant but leaked across tenants. The fixes are surgical (scope queries by tenant_id). This is a natural phase when a project transitions from single-agent to multi-tenant SaaS.

### Security Hardening

- `fix: don't expose raw exception text in compile/LLM error responses` — CodeQL-triggered. Stack trace exposure in prod is a common early-stage vulnerability.
- `Don't mark episodes compiled when a compile batch errors` (#201) — data integrity fix. Prevents silent data loss when LLM compiler fails mid-batch.

### Quickstart & Onboarding

- `Fix quickstart: default .env.example to demo mode, LLM opt-in` — lowering barrier to first run. Smart: let people try with heuristic compiler before requiring an LLM API key.

### Assessment

Statewave is transitioning from research project to production-grade multi-tenant service. The community health upgrade + multi-tenancy hardening + security fixes are all indicators of real deployment pressure. The [[overlap-detection-pattern]] we borrowed from them continues to be relevant.

**Trend**: The memory runtime space is maturing — Statewave and similar projects are moving from "does it work?" to "does it work safely at scale?" This mirrors the broader [[self-evolving-agent-landscape]] consolidation phase.

## Followup: Multi-Tenant Admin Hardening (2026-06-08)

**Stars**: 204 (down from 214 last check — continued decline, but community health score 6/6 THRIVING with 54 external PRs in 30d and 5 unique issue authors)

Burst of 10+ fixes in 2 days (June 6-7), all multi-tenant admin correctness:
- Scope session timeline metrics by tenant (PR #231-232)
- Scope subject stats by tenant
- Match cursor pagination key to sort key in admin receipts
- Subject SLA error response shape consistency
- HMAC constant-time comparison for API key validation
- Memory-id conflict guard on `preserve_ids` import
- Preserve `occurred_at` and reap copied resolutions on snapshot delete
- Preserve input order and guard vector count in embeddings

**Pattern**: Classic multi-tenant security hardening sprint. The HMAC fix (#228) is particularly notable — timing-based API key comparison was a real vulnerability, not just a best practice checkbox.

**Star Decline Analysis**: 214→204 (-4.7%) despite healthy community. Possible explanations: GitHub bot/spam cleanup, niche positioning (memory runtime isn't as flashy as agent frameworks), or normal fluctuation. Community metrics (PRs, contributors) matter more than stars at this stage.

**Assessment**: Still worth tracking. The multi-tenant hardening validates real deployment pressure. Next revisit: 06-15.
