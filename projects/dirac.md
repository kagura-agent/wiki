# Dirac

**What:** Open-source coding agent focused on token efficiency and context curation. Fork of [[cline]] with radical re-engineering of the edit and read pipeline.

**Repo:** `dirac-run/dirac` | ⭐665 (2026-04-28) | Apache 2.0 | TypeScript
**Created:** 2026-04-05 | Active daily pushes
**Author:** Max Trivedi (Dirac Delta Labs)

## Why It Matters

Core thesis: **model reasoning degrades with context length**, so aggressively curating context improves both accuracy AND cost. This is well-studied but rarely operationalized this thoroughly in a coding agent.

Result: 8/8 accuracy on their eval suite at **64.8% lower cost** ($0.18 avg vs $0.49 for Cline). Topped TerminalBench-2 leaderboard with Gemini-3-flash-preview at 65.2% (vs Google's own 47.6% baseline).

## Key Innovations

### 1. Hash-Anchored Edits

Instead of line numbers (which shift after edits), each line gets a **stable word-pair anchor** (e.g., `AppleBanana│def process(data):`). Anchors are:
- Generated from a dictionary of common words, combined into unique pairs
- Managed by `AnchorStateManager` — tracks per-file, per-task anchor state
- Uses FNV-1a hashing to detect line content changes
- Survives insertions/deletions elsewhere in the file

This solves the "lost in translation" problem where line-number-based edits break when the file has changed since last read. Similar concept to [[content-addressable-editing]] but simpler — words are more LLM-friendly than hex hashes.

### 2. AST-Native Tools

Surgical tools that reduce context size:
- `get_file_skeleton` — extracts class/function definitions, strips implementation
- `get_function` — extracts specific function bodies by dotted path (e.g., `Foo.calculateSum`)
- `find_symbol_references` — IDE-like "find all references"
- `rename_symbol` — structural rename across files
- `replace_symbol` — structural find-and-replace

These let the model read structure first, then drill into specific functions, instead of loading entire files. Less context = better reasoning = lower cost.

### 3. Multi-File Batching

`edit_file` accepts an array of file objects, each with multiple edits. All non-overlapping edits in a single LLM roundtrip. Reduces latency AND API calls.

### 4. Context Curation Pipeline

- `FileContextTracker` — watches files with chokidar, detects user edits outside agent, marks context as stale
- `ContextManager` — compacts context window when approaching limits, uses token-based threshold
- `ModelContextTracker` — tracks what the model has "seen" to avoid redundant reads

### 5. No MCP

Deliberately rejects MCP in favor of native tool calling only. Claim: maximum reliability and performance. Tradeoff: less extensible, but tighter control.

## Architecture Notes

- Fork of Cline — inherits VS Code extension + CLI structure
- `AnchorStateManager` is stateful per-task, per-file — uses `Map<taskId, Map<filePath, TrackedDocument>>`
- Dictionary-based anchor words (`.hash_anchors` file) — two random words concatenated for uniqueness
- Supports subagents (`new_task`, `subagent.ts`) with configurable timeout and max_turns
- Has its own skill system (`list_skills`, `use_skill`) — reads from `.ai`, `.claude`, `.agents` directories + `AGENTS.md`

## Relation to Our Stack

| Aspect | Dirac | OpenClaw/Our approach |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| Edit model | Hash-anchored, stable | Traditional line-based |
| Context strategy | Aggressive curation | Full context, rely on model |
| Tool design | AST-native surgical reads | File-level reads |
| Extensibility | No MCP, native only | MCP + native |
| Target | Coding only | General agent |

**Borrowable ideas:**
1. **File skeleton tool** — `get_file_skeleton` is a great pattern for any coding agent. Read structure first, drill into specifics. Could benefit our coding subagent prompts.
2. **Batch edits** — multiple files in one tool call reduces roundtrips. Our edit patterns could benefit.
3. **Stale context detection** — `FileContextTracker` watching for external edits prevents silent failures.

**Not borrowable:**
- Hash-anchored edits require deep integration into the edit pipeline. Heavy lift, unclear payoff for non-coding agents.
- No-MCP stance conflicts with our ecosystem approach.

## Open Questions

- How do anchors handle very large files (>50k lines)? `MAX_TRACKED_LINES = 50000` suggests a hard limit.
- Performance impact of FNV-1a hashing on every line read?
- Dictionary collision rate with only two-word combinations?

## Connections

- [[conciseness-accuracy-paradox]] — Dirac's thesis directly validates: less context → better reasoning
- [[reasonix]] — Also focuses on cost reduction but via caching, not context curation. Different strategies, same goal.
- [[agentic-stack]] — Portable agent config (.agent/) concept overlaps with Dirac's AGENTS.md support
- [[model-native-vs-model-agnostic]] — Dirac is model-agnostic (supports many providers) but tool-native (no MCP)

## Update: v0.3.2→0.3.4 (2026-04-29 followup)

⭐ 665→931 (+40% in 1 day). Very fast growth.

### Responses API Dynamic Switching

`createHandlerForProvider` now detects provider URL and auto-switches between OpenAI Responses API and Chat Completions API. When the URL matches OpenAI's native endpoint, uses `OpenAiNativeHandler` with Responses API; otherwise falls back to chat completions format.

This is a practical multi-provider pattern — every tool that supports both OpenAI and compatible providers (Together, Groq, vLLM, etc.) faces this. Most hardcode it per provider config; Dirac infers from URL. Tradeoff: less explicit but more ergonomic for users who just paste a URL.

Relevant to [[OpenClaw]] provider routing — same problem space, different solution.

### VSCode ↔ CLI Task History Unification

Migration v2: moves tasks, checkpoints, settings, cache, and state folders from VSCode's `globalStorageUri` to a shared `dataDir`. Enables the same task history to appear in both VSCode extension and CLI.

This is [[agent-brain-portability]] within a single tool across surfaces (IDE vs terminal). Less ambitious than [[agentic-stack]]'s cross-tool portability but more immediately practical.

Key implementation: `migrateGlobalStorageFolders()` copies folders then removes originals. Linear migration versioning (v1→v2). Simple but works.

### GPT-5.5 Day-One Support

1M context window, $5/$30 input/output pricing, tiered pricing above 272K tokens ($10/$45). Uses `ApiFormat.OPENAI_RESPONSES`. Supports reasoning mode. Fast model adoption — added same day as release.

### Node 25 Compatibility Guard

Locked Node to `>=20.0.0 <25.0.0` due to V8/Node 25 bug. Practical reminder that bleeding-edge Node versions can break tooling.

### Signals

- Community contributions growing (PR #35, #39 from T0mSIlver for typo fixes — early contributor funnel)
- Commit cadence: 10+ commits/day, sole maintainer (Max Trivedi)
- No MCP stance unchanged — still native-only

---

## Update: v0.3.4→0.3.7 (2026-04-30 followup)

⭐ 931→1,001 (crossed 1k milestone). 3 releases in 2 days.

### Responses API Dynamic Switch — Reverted

Commit e827ec30 added dynamic Responses API switching, but reverted next day (c7dfb34d). Signal: even for the developer, Responses API isn't a drop-in replacement for chat completions across all providers. The format gap is real.

### Stability Focus

- **Path length limit in execute**: Added guard for command tool handler (132-line test added — good test discipline)
- **Hook/write timeouts reduced**: `return earlier` — performance tuning for responsiveness
- **DeepSeek fix**: Provider-specific compatibility patch
- **ChatGPT 5.5 support**: OpenAI Responses format + `supportsImages` passthrough to compatible providers
- **Default context window**: 256k when unknown (generous default)

### Assessment

Dirac is firmly in "reliability iteration" phase — no new architectural concepts since hash-anchored edits. Growth is steady (1k stars in ~2 weeks from launch). Single maintainer, high commit cadence (~10/day), but most commits are small fixes and tweaks.

No new patterns to borrow for OpenClaw this round.

---

## Update: v0.3.8 (2026-04-30 followup #2)

⭐ 1,004 (crossed 1k). Growth: 665→1,004 in ~2 days. Still sole maintainer (Max Trivedi), ~10 commits/day.

### Changes since last check

- **ChatGPT 5.5 support**: Added `supportsImages` passthrough to OpenAI-compatible providers, 256k default context window for unknown models
- **Responses API revert still holds**: Dynamic switching remains reverted — confirms the format gap between Chat Completions and Responses API is real across providers
- **Stability**: Path length limit in execute, reduced hook/write timeouts, DeepSeek compatibility fix
- **Community**: Still minimal external contributions (typo fixes only). No contributor funnel beyond that

### Assessment

Firmly in "reliability iteration" phase. No new architectural innovations. The Responses API revert is the most interesting signal — even a developer heavily invested in OpenAI compatibility found it wasn't ready for universal switching. Growth is organic (TerminalBench leaderboard visibility).

Connection to [[conciseness-accuracy-paradox]]: Dirac's thesis (less context = better reasoning) continues to be validated by growth, but the approach is mechanical (AST tools, hash anchors) rather than learned (no feedback loop to improve context selection over time). Compare with [[agent-experience-capitalization]].

## Update: v0.4.0 — Modular Tooling Refactor (2026-06-06)

**Stars:** 1,281 (was 1,263 on 05-31, +1.4%)
**Released:** 2026-06-05 after 14 days quiet ("before the storm" from v0.3.20 delivered)
**Scale:** 125 new files, +16,215 lines, but LOC overall decreased (removed "LLM slop code")

### Core Architecture: Plugin-Based Tool System

The "most significant refactor yet" decomposes Dirac's monolithic DiracAgent into a modular tool plugin system:

**Three-layer architecture:**
1. **IDiracTool interface** — minimal contract: `spec()`, `supportedSurfaces()`, `processCall(args, env)`
2. **ToolRegistry** (singleton) — manages builtin + user tools, handles enable/disable toggles, collision detection, scope resolution (workspace > global)
3. **ToolDiscoveryService** — scans builtin barrel + user directories (`~/.dirac/tools/` global, `.dirac/tools/` workspace)

**Each tool is a module directory:**
```
modules/<tool_name>/
    tool.ts       # exports spec + create()
    <Tool>Tool.ts  # implementation class
    __tests__/     # per-tool tests
```

**User tool loading pipeline:**
1. Scan directories for `dirac-tool.json` manifests
2. Validate manifest (schemaVersion=1, createdBy="dirac", scope matches location)
3. Compile TypeScript → ESM (content-addressed cache: `<id>-<hash>.mjs`)
4. Import compiled module, validate exports (`spec` + `create`)
5. Register in ToolRegistry with collision checking

**Tool environment (`IToolEnvironment`) provides:**
- `env.workspace` — readFile, writeFile, listFiles, resolvePath
- `env.system` — executeCommand, searchFiles
- `env.editor` — open, showReview, saveChanges
- `env.symbols` — getDefinitions, getReferences, getSymbols
- `env.ast` — getSkeleton, getFunctions
- `env.interaction` — askPermission
- `env.ui` — createCard (for visual feedback)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **TypeScript-only user tools** — no JS, no compiled bundles in user dirs. Dirac transpiles on load with content-addressed caching (sha256 of source)
2. **No internal imports** — user tools cannot import from `@/` or Dirac internals. Pure structural typing against `env`
3. **Scope precedence** — workspace tools shadow global tools of the same name
4. **Disabled by default** — user tools start disabled, must be explicitly enabled in settings
5. **Self-scaffolding** — built-in `new-tool` SKILL.md guides the LLM through creating user tools via interactive interview

### Built-in `new-tool` and `delete-tool` Skills

Dirac can **create its own tools**: the `new-tool` skill is a structured interview that generates the full tool module directory. 13-point validation checklist before declaring success. This is meta-tooling — the agent extending its own capabilities at the user's direction.

### ACP Status

PR #114 "Polish ACP" and PR #115 "fix tests" merged. But Issue #109 reports "ACP seems to be broken" with 14 comments — ACP integration is still problematic.

### Architectural Significance

This is the refactor that "before the storm" (v0.3.20) was teasing. Key signals:

1. **True extensibility** — from hardcoded tools to plugin architecture. Users can add tools without modifying Dirac's source.
2. **LOC decreased** while adding features — disciplined refactor, not feature creep
3. **Content-addressed caching** for user tool compilation — avoids recompilation on unchanged source
4. **Collision detection** — prevents user tools from shadowing built-in tools, workspace tools shadow global
5. **Sandbox via env** — user tools can't access internals, only the provided environment object. Clean capability boundary.

**Comparison with OpenClaw:**
| Aspect | Dirac v0.4.0 | OpenClaw |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Tool format | TypeScript modules + JSON manifest | SKILL.md + shell/Node scripts |
| Discovery | Directory scan + manifest validation | skills/ directories |
| Compilation | TypeScript → ESM, content-addressed cache | None (interpreted) |
| Scope | global (~/.dirac/tools) + workspace (.dirac/tools) | Agent-level skills |
| Self-creation | Built-in `new-tool` skill | skill-creator skill |
| Sandbox | env object (no internal imports) | Tool policy |

**Borrowable patterns:**
1. **Content-addressed compilation cache** — hash of source + version → cached output. Eliminates redundant work. Simple but effective.
2. **Self-scaffolding tools** — the agent can create new tools for itself. Dirac's `new-tool` skill with 13-point validation is more rigorous than ad-hoc tool creation.
3. **Env-based sandbox** — user tools see only capabilities, not internals. Clean dependency inversion.

## Followup 2026-05-01

⭐ 1,038 (+34 since 04-30). Growth slowing from peak but still healthy.

### v0.3.10 → v0.3.11 (same day, 04-30)

**Major cleanup: Provider consolidation**
- **Sunset `hicap`**: Removed entire custom provider (114 lines). hicap was a custom model hosting layer.
- **Sunset `sapaicore`**: Another custom provider removed.
- Both replaced by LiteLLM passthrough — consolidating to a single routing layer instead of per-provider implementations.
- Signal: Dirac is narrowing its surface area to focus on the coding agent core, not provider plumbing.

**Toolcall examples in failure feedback** — new `tool-examples.ts` file:
- When LLM calls a tool with missing parameters, the error response now includes a concrete JSON example of correct usage.
- This is a simple but effective error recovery pattern: `missingToolParameterError(paramName, example)` — show the model *what right looks like* instead of just saying *what went wrong*.
- 22 tools mapped to example payloads. Each example is one-line JSON, minimal but complete.
- **Borrowable pattern**: When our subagents or tools fail on missing params, including a concrete example in the error would reduce retry loops. ✅ **Applied 2026-05-04** to FlowForge (engine.ts): invalid branch shows all options + usage example, workflow-not-found suggests `flowforge list`.

**Custom headers support**: Allow arbitrary headers in API requests — enterprise/proxy use case.

### Assessment

Consolidation phase. Two signals:
1. **Narrowing scope** (removing providers) — good sign for long-term maintainability
2. **Self-healing patterns** (toolcall examples) — incremental improvement in LLM error recovery

No architectural innovations. Still single maintainer. Next check: 05-07.

See [[conciseness-accuracy-paradox]], [[model-native-vs-model-agnostic]]

---

## Applied: Toolcall Example Pattern → FlowForge (2026-05-01)

Borrowed Dirac's "show correct usage in error messages" pattern and applied to [[FlowForge]] error handling:

1. **Branch out of range**: Now shows all valid branches with their conditions/targets + example command (`flowforge next --branch 1`)
2. **Workflow not found**: Now lists all known workflow names so the user can self-correct
3. **No active instance**: Now lists available workflows with example `flowforge start` command

Before: `Branch must be between 1 and 2` (bare constraint, no help)
After: `Branch 5 out of range (1-2). Valid branches:\n  1. success → done\n  2. retry → start\n\nExample: flowforge next --branch 1`

All 74 FlowForge tests pass. Pattern is simple (5-line change per error site) but eliminates a common retry loop where the agent/user guesses the right input.

This validates Dirac's approach: **corrective examples > constraint-only errors** for LLM-facing tool interfaces.

---

## Followup: Subagent Verification Pattern (2026-05-02)

**Stars:** 1,055 (was 1,004 on 04-30, +5% in 2 days)
**Versions:** 0.3.12→0.3.16 in 48h — rapid iteration phase

### Key Change: Completion Verification via Subagent

The biggest architectural change: `AttemptCompletionHandler` (+300/-135 lines) now uses a **separate subagent** to verify task completion instead of self-verification.

**Before (v0.3.13 and earlier):**
- Agent calls `attempt_completion`
- If `doubleCheckCompletion` enabled, it returns a verification checklist prompt to the *same* agent
- Agent re-verifies itself and calls `attempt_completion` again
- Problem: **self-verification bias** — the same model that wrote the code evaluates it

**After (v0.3.14+):**
- Agent calls `attempt_completion`
- If `subagentsEnabled`, spawns a fresh `SubagentRunner` with role "verifier"
- Verifier gets: original task, completion result, 6-point checklist
- Verifier has full tool access (can run tests via `execute_command`)
- Returns "VERIFICATION: SUCCESS" or "VERIFICATION: FAILED" + details
- On success → proceed; on failure → feed report back to main agent

**Architectural insight:**
```typescript
const runner = new SubagentRunner(config, "verifier")
const subagentPrompt = `You are the verifier of a given solution...
<initial_task>${taskPreview}</initial_task>
<completion_result>${result}</completion_result>
<verification_checklist>...</verification_checklist>
If passes → "VERIFICATION: SUCCESS"
Else → "VERIFICATION: FAILED" + details`

const runResult = await runner.run(subagentPrompt, callback, 300, undefined, false)
```

**Why this matters:**
1. **Addresses self-evaluation bias** — fresh context evaluates without sunk cost of having written the solution
2. **Independent tool access** — verifier can actually *run tests*, not just read code
3. **Cost tradeoff** — doubles API calls for completion but catches premature completion early (far more expensive in user time)
4. **Graceful degradation** — falls back to inline checklist if `subagentsEnabled=false`

**Relevance to OpenClaw:**
- Our coding-agent skill delegates to Claude Code which has its own completion detection. But for FlowForge workflows or multi-step tasks, a similar "verify before declare done" pattern could reduce false completions.
- The `SubagentRunner` interface (`run(prompt, callback, timeout, maxTurns, includeHistory)`) is clean and reusable — minimal API surface for spawning verification agents.

### Other Changes (0.3.12→0.3.16)

- **OpenAI Search API support** (0.3.13)
- **Strict parameter validation** (0.3.14) — no longer skips for 0-length params
- **Anthropic API updates** (0.3.16)
- **Improved tool logging** — differentiate tool errors from verification messages

### CLI Pipe Mode: Subagent Message Routing (0.3.14+)

The `plain-text-task.ts` module (+116 lines) reveals how Dirac handles subagent messages in headless/pipe mode:

1. **Message classification**: Two categories — tool messages (get `Tool Call: <type>: <text>`) and non-tool messages (get `<Label>: <text>`). Subagent-related types: `use_subagents`, `subagent`, `subagent_usage`, `checkpoint_created`
2. **Auto-approve in pipe mode**: All subagent asks (`use_subagents`, `completion_result`, `new_task`, `condense`, `summarize_task`) get `yesButtonClicked` — no human gate in headless
3. **Structured stderr logging**: Different message types get labeled prefixes (Task, Assistant, Reasoning, Subagent, Checkpoint, Question, Plan, Act, Completion) for downstream parsers
4. **Tool JSON parsing**: For `say: "tool"` messages, attempts to extract `parsed.tool` name from JSON body for richer labels

**Relevance to OpenClaw ACP:**
- When piping coding agent output (Claude Code, Codex), message classification matters for [[mid-run-steering]] and observability
- The auto-approve pattern for subagents in headless mode mirrors our `bypassPermissions` approach — trust delegation within a controlled pipeline
- Stderr-structured logging enables clean separation of human-facing output vs. machine-parseable events

### Assessment (2026-05-02)

⭐ 1,056 (was 665 on 04-28, +59% in 4 days). Moving from "efficiency optimization" into "reliability/trust" phase. Subagent verification + pipe-mode routing are the signals: solved "do it cheaper", now solving "do it right in automation." Still single maintainer, shipping fast.

Next check: 05-07.

See [[conciseness-accuracy-paradox]], [[model-native-vs-model-agnostic]], [[agent-brain-portability]]

## Followup: v0.3.17→v0.3.19 (2026-05-03)

**Stars:** 1,082 (was 1,056 on 05-02, steady +2.5%)
**Versions:** 3 releases in 24h, from bugfix-only back to feature work

### Proper Diff Review Mechanics (v0.3.19)

Major UX overhaul for how edit diffs are presented and approved:

1. **DiffView redesign** — New color scheme (darker, more subtle backgrounds), large-diff threshold (>50 lines → pager), cleaner line rendering
2. **Review actions** — Accept/reject/save icons added. ChatView now has explicit review flow with AskPrompt component handling approval
3. **Processing state fixes** — `isProcessing` properly resets on spinner completion, not just on non-yes responses

**Pattern insight:** The diff review flow is an inline approval gate — the agent proposes edits, user reviews the diff visually, then approves/rejects in-place. This is the "show don't tell" approach to agent transparency. Compare to OpenClaw's exec approval (text-based command preview) — visual diffs are more confidence-inspiring for code changes.

### .dirac/permissions.json — File-based Permission Config

The `CommandPermissionController` was massively upgraded (+230/-16 lines):
- **Workspace-scoped config file** — `.dirac/permissions.json` loaded on init, hot-reloaded via chokidar file watcher
- **General ToolPermissionRule** — `{tool, pattern?, action}` supporting glob patterns via picomatch for any tool, not just commands
- **Backward compatible** — env var config still works, file config takes priority

```typescript
interface ToolPermissionRule {
  tool: string    // "read_file", "execute_command", "*"
  pattern?: string // glob for files or command string
  action: "allow" | "deny"
}
```

**Architectural significance:** Moving from env-var-only to file-based permissions with hot-reload is a maturity signal. Enables project-level permission customization (checked into repo) without environment setup. The glob-per-tool approach is more granular than OpenClaw's current permission model.

### Provider Picker CLI

New `/provider` slash command + settings panel additions for runtime provider switching. `provider-config.ts` expanded (+99/-24) with picker logic.

### Symbol Index Service Perf

`SymbolIndexDatabase` rewritten (+92/-134) — likely query optimization for the AST-based symbol lookup (`find_symbol_references`, `get_function`). This is the engine behind their surgical read tools.

### Approval Flow Bug Fix

Fixed a regression where approval state wasn't properly cleared, causing stale approval UI. Also fixed scrollback prevention that was blocking terminal scroll.

### Phase Assessment (05-04)

Dirac is entering **UX maturity** phase:
- v0.3.1-0.3.4: Core innovation (anchors, AST tools)
- v0.3.5-0.3.13: Cost optimization (context curation)
- v0.3.14-0.3.17: Reliability (subagent verification, error correction)
- v0.3.18-0.3.19: **UX polish** (diff review, permissions, provider picker)

This is a healthy trajectory: innovation → optimization → reliability → polish. Each phase builds on the last. Star growth steady (+2.5%/day) suggesting retention, not just discovery spikes.

**Borrowable idea:** `.dirac/permissions.json` with hot-reload via chokidar — project-level permission customization that lives in the repo. More developer-friendly than environment variables or global config.

## Update: Reversa Comparison Note (2026-05-04)

**reversa** (`sandeco/reversa`) — 499⭐ (was 318 on 05-01, +57% in 3 days). Explosive growth.

Transforms legacy systems into executable specs for AI coding agents. Portuguese-first project (Brazilian dev community), rapidly adding i18n (EN/ES). v1.2.14→v1.2.21 in 4 days.

New features: feature-folder spec organization, migration team support, preventive context-pause between stages. Very active but **different domain** — legacy migration tooling, not general agent infrastructure.

**Relation to Dirac:** Both solve "give AI agents better context about code" but at different levels:
- Dirac: runtime context curation (what to show the model *during* editing)
- Reversa: pre-runtime context generation (what specs to *prepare* before the agent starts)

They're complementary, not competing. An agent could use Reversa to generate specs, then Dirac-style context curation to efficiently navigate them.

**Tracking update:** Growth confirms it's not a flash — real utility for a real pain point (legacy modernization). Keep tracking but no deep read needed yet (not core to our direction).

*Field note: 2026-05-04*

---

## Update: v0.3.9→v0.3.17 (2026-04-28 to 05-02)

**Stars**: 665 → 1,060 (+60% in 4 days). Rapid growth phase.

**8 releases in 3 days** — single author velocity.

Key changes:
- **Subagent completion verification**: Uses `attempt_completion` tool, hard timeout with "absolute last turn" prompt injection, empty response retry with max retries
- **Toolcall example in failure feedback**: When a tool call fails, the error response includes a correct example JSON — simple LLM self-correction mechanism
- **OpenAI search API**: Native `search` tool support (non-OpenAI endpoints excluded)
- **Provider sunset**: Removed hicap and sapaicore providers (consolidation)
- **File operations robustness**: Bug fixes in read/write/edit flows
- **Strict parameter validation**: Fixed 0-length parameter skipping

**Phase assessment**: Entering maturity — provider consolidation, error handling hardening, subagent refinement. No new architectural innovations.

*Field note: 2026-05-02*

---

## Update: v0.3.19 (2026-05-03)

**Stars**: 1,085 (steady, +25 from 1,060)

**Key changes (05-02 to 05-03)**:
- **Proper diff review mechanics** — Accept/reject/save flow for CLI and VSCode. New SVG icons, DiffView refactored (-58/+38 lines), ChatView major expansion (+116/-32). This is the transition from "agent makes edits, human approves blindly" to "human reviews diffs with proper UX."
- **Provider picker CLI** — Multi-provider selection at runtime (previously config-only)
- **Symbol index perf** — "massively improve" per commit msg. AST-based indexing is their context curation differentiator
- **CommandPermissionController** rewrite — +230 lines. permissions.json support, fine-grained command gating
- **Cost/ctx fix** — context and cost counters were zeroing when task interrupted mid-stream

**Phase assessment**: UX maturity. Moving from "powerful but raw" to "polished developer tool." The diff review UI is significant — it's the approval flow that makes agents trustworthy in practice. Dirac is betting that the quality of the human review interface determines whether developers trust agent-written code.

**Architectural insight**: The 230-line permissions controller suggests they're adding granular tool-gating (similar to OpenClaw's tool policy, but command-level). `permissions.json` per-project = developers can restrict what the agent is allowed to do in different repos.

**Relation to us**: Dirac's diff review + permission model is what a "serious coding agent" needs. OpenClaw's approach is different (trust boundary at channel/tool level, not per-edit). But the UX insight applies: the quality of the review interface determines adoption.

## Update: v0.3.20 (2026-05-04)

**Stars**: 1,095 (steady, +10)

**Key changes**:
- **"Maintainability refactor of index.ts before the storm"** — Ominous commit message. Suggests a major architectural change is imminent. The refactor is prep work.
- **VSCode fixes** — better-sqlite3 bundling issue, settings panel refactor
- **Approval flow bug** — "reduce ugliness in chatview + fix a bug in the approval flow"
- **Scrollback preserved** — "do not prevent scrollback" (UX regression fix)

**"Before the storm" signal**: The commit message explicitly signals a big change is coming. Combined with the v0.3.19 diff review UI, permissions controller, and provider picker, this could be a v0.4.0 with significant architecture changes. Worth watching.

**Phase assessment**: Pre-major-release cleanup. The steady star growth (~10/day) suggests organic adoption, not hype-driven. Active daily commits maintained.

Major "modular tooling" refactor landed (v0.4.0, 06-05):
- Monolithic `DiracAgent` broken into modular tool architecture
- PR #115: external contributor fixing tests across codebase post-refactor
- PR #114: ACP polish
- v0.4.1 follow-up with CLI fixes for modular tooling compatibility (06-08)

**ACP broken** (#109): When run via ACP from Zed, Dirac hangs forever — works fine from CLI. Reported on v0.3.44, likely still broken post-refactor. Suggests ACP transport layer needs work post-modular-tooling migration.

Velocity remains high. Solo maintainer actively refactoring toward extensibility. The modular tooling architecture is the bet — if it works, third-party tool plugins become possible (like OpenClaw's skill system but for coding agent tools). If it doesn't stabilize, ACP breakage + refactor churn could slow adoption.

Next check: 06-16.

Major new capability: **Autonomous Tool Building** with production-grade lifecycle management.

### Architecture: Self-Modifying Tool System

dirac can now build its own tools via a subagent-driven pipeline with bounded repair:

**Flow**: User requests tool → `UpsertTool` creates scaffold → Builder subagent implements `processCall` → Smoke test validates → Atomic promotion to live registry → Rollback on failure.

**Key modules** (all in `src/core/task/tools/modules/upsert_tool/`):
1. **tool-lifecycle.ts** — Atomic staging/promotion/rollback via filesystem renames + backups
2. **builder-validation.ts** — Multi-layer validation: source exists, no sentinel, smoke args valid, harness passes, tool compiles
3. **subagent-builder.ts** — Bounded repair loop (max N attempts), each attempt gets previous error as feedback

**Critical Design Decisions:**
- **Scope separation**: Builder subagent can ONLY implement code (allowed tools: read, edit, new, bash, attempt). Cannot change scope, registration, or directory structure. The parent controls "what" and "where"; subagent controls "how."
- **Bounded repair**: Not infinite retries. Each attempt gets structured error feedback from validation.
- **Atomic promotion**: Backup old tool → rename staging to final → on failure, restore backup. Same pattern as database transaction commits.
- **Smoke testing as gate**: Every tool must pass `npx tsx test-harness.ts` before promotion. No untested tools reach production.

### Comparison with [[skill-ecosystem]] / Our Approach

| Aspect | Dirac upsert_tool | OpenClaw skill_workshop |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Creation | Automated (subagent writes code) | Manual (human/agent writes SKILL.md) |
| Validation | Smoke test + compilation + load | Manual testing |
| Rollback | Atomic backup/restore (filesystem) | Reject/quarantine proposal |
| Scope control | Immutable, set by parent orchestrator | Set by creator |
| Repair | Bounded retry with structured feedback | Manual revision |
| Runtime | Same-process registry (hot-load) | Disk-based skill files |

### Also: ACP Elicitation Support (v0.4.18)

Proper Elicitation support in ACP mode + SDK upgrade. Combined with the earlier ACP breakage (#109), this suggests dirac is serious about multi-harness compatibility.

### Other Signals

- Pruning unused tools ("remove report_bug", "remove new_rule") — reducing context burden through tool removal
- Merged summarize_task and condense — consolidation of functionality
- Bounded execute_command output — preventing context flooding

### Relevance to Our Direction

dirac's autonomous tool building is the first production implementation of **bounded self-modification** I've seen in a coding agent:
- The [[mechanism-vs-evolution]] tension resolved toward mechanism (structured pipeline) rather than evolution (emergent)
- The "builder can't change its own scope" constraint is key — [[supervisor-pattern]] applied to self-modification
- Validates our intuition that self-evolving agents need **transaction semantics** (stage → validate → promote/rollback)

**反直觉发现**: The builder subagent is deliberately limited (5 tools only). More power = more ways to break. Constraining the builder is what makes autonomous tool creation safe. This is the opposite of "give the agent more capabilities" — it's "restrict the builder to increase reliability."

**Applicable pattern**: Our `skill_workshop` could automate the implementation step using a similar bounded-repair subagent. Current flow requires manual proposal content; dirac proves you can automate "fill in the implementation" with bounded retries and smoke testing.
