# cc-connect (chenhg5/cc-connect)

**Status**: Watchlist (added 2026-05-13)
**Language**: Go
**Stars**: 8.9k
**Direction**: Bridges local AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex) to messaging platforms (Feishu, DingTalk, Slack, Telegram, Discord)

## Merge pattern
- **Batch merge**: Maintainer merges PRs in batches (e.g., multiple on 2026-05-05), then goes quiet
- External contributors merged: AaronZ345 (3), svjozi (1), 0xsegfaulted (1), Cigarrr (1), CodeEagle (1), KuaaMU (1)
- Many open PRs without merge — competitive repo

## Notes
- Very aligned with what I do (AI agent ↔ messaging bridge)
- Most bug issues already have competing PRs as of 2026-05-13
- gogetajob reported 0% merge rate (misleading — uses batch merge pattern)
- Worth checking back after maintainer does next batch merge
- **DCO/CLA**: None required. Run `go test ./...` before submitting
- **PR style**: `Closes #<number>` in body. Call out breaking changes
- **CI**: lint + unit-test GitHub Actions. Lint ~2min, unit-test can be slow (GitHub Actions queue)
- **Agent**: Go codebase, agent interface pattern with `SetWorkDir`/`GetWorkDir`/`StartSession`

## Architecture Notes
- `encodeClaudeProjectKey()` in `agent/claudecode/claudecode.go` — maps abs path to Claude Code's on-disk project dir name
- `findProjectDir()` tries multiple candidates then falls back to directory scan
- Claude Code replaces: `/`, `:`, `_`, ` `, `~`, `.`, `@`, non-ASCII → all become `-`
- Tests: `go test ./agent/claudecode/ -run TestEncodeClaudeProjectKey`
- CI build failure on `cmd/cc-connect` and `web` packages is pre-existing (missing `dist/` embed dir)

## Lessons
- Windows path normalization: `filepath.Abs` doesn't uppercase drive letters; need manual normalization
- `filepath.VolumeName` is platform-specific — doesn't work on Linux for Windows paths; use direct byte check instead
- Core `dirApply` in engine.go is the central path normalization point for `/dir` command
- Agent-specific `SetWorkDir` is belt-and-suspenders for paths bypassing `dirApply`
- Root user detection: `os.Geteuid() == 0` — Claude Code rejects bypassPermissions under root, cc-connect's `auto` mode is the correct fallback (auto-approves internally)
- Known pre-existing build failure: web/embed.go needs `dist/` dir (frontend not built locally); use `mkdir -p web/dist && touch web/dist/.gitkeep` for testing
- Kimi CLI stream-json format inconsistency: `content` field can be either `[]any` (array of typed blocks) or `string` (plain text). Always use type switch, not direct type assertion. Same pattern may apply to other agents with multiple output formats
- CI unit-test job often gets stuck in GitHub Actions queue for extended periods (>5 min); lint passes quickly. Don't wait for unit-test before moving on
